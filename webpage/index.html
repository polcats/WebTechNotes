<h4>Characteristics of a Protocol</h4>

	<span class="item">Servers </span>

<h4>Kinds of intermediary nodes</h4>
	<span class="item">Proxies</span>
	<span class="desc">Message forwarding agent that is selected by the client, ussually via local configuration rules, to receive reqeuests
			 For some kind of absolute URI and atttempt to satisfy those requests via translation through the HTTP interface.</span>
	<span class="item">Gateways</span>
	<span class="desc">An origin server for the outbound connection but translates received requests and forwards them inbound to another server or servers</span>
	<span class="item">Tunnels</span>
	<span class="desc">Acts as a blind relay between two connections without changing the messages. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party to the 
			 the HTTP communication (Typically used in SSL connections)</span>




<h4>Persistent connections and Request Pipelining</h4>

	<ul>
	<li>When establishing a socket connection it goes through these steps (request, response, disconnect)</li>
	<li>1 socket connection per request typically</li>
	<li>With persistent connections we can re use connnections </li>
	<li>In HTTP 1.0 there are no persisten connections</li>
	<li>With each connection comes the setting up of buffers, parsers, handlers, sockets etc. </li>
	</ul>

	<span class="desc">Synchronization of requests to avoid load</span>
	<span class="desc">Can only make request after response and disconnection</span>


	<h4>HTTP</h4> 
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP is a stateless communications protocols (servers do not keep information)</li>
		<li>uses request-response standard protocol</li>
		<li>client sends an HTTP Request message to the server ("pull" & "poll", like a regular check)</li>
		<li>server process --> HTTP Response Message 'push" --> HTTP 2 --> server can notify</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>HTTP Supported Functionalities</h4> 

		<ul>
		<li>cache control</li>
		<li>content media type(MIME) specifications (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)</li>
		<li>language & character set specification</li>
		<li>content / transfer codings</li>
		<li>content negotiation</li>
		</ul>

		<span class="note">The 5 functionalities said above says that there has to be an agreement between client and server
		(client-server) protocol negotiations.</span>

		<ul>
		<li>persistent connections</li>
		<li>request pipelining</li>

	<h4>HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Identification of different resources</li>
	<li>Retrieving resources requires naming them</li>
	<li>The resources are identified using URIs</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</h4>
	<span class="item">URN</span>
	<span class="desc">Simply refers to name (e.g ISBN)</span>
	
	<span class="item">URL</span>
	<span class="desc">Uniform resource locator. Identifiers and specifiers on how to find and access info</span>


	<h4>HTTP URI Components</h4>

		<li><span class="item">scheme (HTTP or HTTPS)</span></li>
		<li><span class="item">authority</span>
			<span class="desc">user information(deprecated)</span>
			<span class="desc">host (simply where the resource is located)</span>
			<span class="desc">port number</span></li>

			<span class="desc">start at the document root; static or dynamic resource</span></li>
		<li><span class="item">query </span>
			<span class="desc">starts with a  (?); typically provided as a key value with (&) --> separates parameters</span>
			<span class="desc">may be URL encoded</span></li>
		<li><span class="item">fragment identifier</span>
			<span class="desc">starts with a (#) --> sometimes called a bookmark</span></li>
		</ul>

	<h4>HTTP URI Scheme</h4>
	  <span class="item">HTTP-URI </span>
	  <span class="desc">= "http: " "//" authority path-abempty [ "?" query] [ "#" fragment]</span>

	 <ul>
	 <li>origin server for an "http" URI is identified by the authority component, which includes
	  	a host identifier and optional TCP port.</li>
	 <li>By default, if port is not specified then TCP port 80 will be used by default</li>
	 <li>Domain names are always resolved to IP addresses </li>
	 </ul>



	<h4>HTTPS URI Scheme</h4>
	 <span class="item">HTTPS-URI</span>
	 <span class="desc">="https:" "//" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment]</span>
	 <span class="note">Note that the "https" URI scheme depends on both TLS and TCP for establishing authority.</span>
